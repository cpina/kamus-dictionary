    <h1>Information</h1>
    <h2>What is this?</h2>
    <p>
        First and most important thing: currently this is a <em>personal toy project</em>. Do not rely on Kamus. It
        might have downtimes, might disappear, it might change the structure. On the other hand I'm using it daily so I
        plan to keep maintaining.
    </p>
    <p>
        I had two things in mind:
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>How to make translation data from Wiktionary easier to access? (starting for me)</li>
        <li>Learn more about Wiktionary structure and project</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
        Kamus dictionary tries to help a user to find the translations from Wiktionary. It reads the
        relevant pages and presents translation information in an easier way filtering out what's not
        needed for the translations.
    </p>
    <p>
        As an example, try to find the translation from English "table" to Catalan using the <a
            href="https://kamus.pina.cat/translate/?from=en&to=ca&word=table">Wiktionary page</a> or the <a
            href="https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/table">Kamus page</a>.
    </p>
    <p>
        I hope that Kamus might help some users to use Wiktionary and hopefully to improve Wiktionary.
    </p>

    <h2>More languages are coming</h2>
    <p>
        Probably the next ones will be from Catalan and Spanish. I have some ideas to make "from any to any" instead
        of having to implement languages manually but I'm still evaluating it.
    </p>
    <h2>Quick "good to know"</h2>
    <p>
        When loading a translation the data is fetched from Wiktionary in real time. If you edit Wiktionary and reload
        Kamus you will see the improvements in real time.
    </p>
    <p>
        The <em>list of words</em> for the autocompletion is fetched regularly (about once a week). New entries
        on Wiktionary will take some time to appear in the autocompletion list of Kamus.
